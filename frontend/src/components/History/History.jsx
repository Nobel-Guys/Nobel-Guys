          Alfred Nobel (1833-1896) was born in Stockholm, Sweden, on 21 October
          1833. His family was descended from Olof Rudbeck, the best-known
          technical genius in Sweden in the 17th century, an era in which Sweden
          was a great power in northern Europe. Nobel was fluent in several
          languages, and wrote poetry and drama. Nobel was also very interested
          in social and peace-related issues, and held views that were
          considered radical during his time. Alfred Nobelâ€™s interests are
          reflected in the prize he established. Learn more about his life and
          his interests (science, inventions, entrepreneurship, literature and
          peace work.)
